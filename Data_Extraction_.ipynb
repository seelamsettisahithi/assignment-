            "[\"Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets seePROS1.  Its easy to use2. Decent battery backup3. Live mode operation is not lagging.CONS1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.Its not worth for money\", 'Good camera for beginners.', 'Great camera. Perfect product for young budding photographer..... Useful for in-house, nature, functions, and spare time photography. Take high quality pics, videos , portrait, landscape wildlife, nature pics etc', 'Really impressed with Amazon surprise for delivering within the 2 nd day from ordered Really packing was excellent and the quality of the material is awesome love to control the camera from mobile through Wi-Fi easy to connect, best one for taking self photos and group pics also the quality of canon speaks everything dont go for any oscillation beginners blindly got for it', 'You are on your own if you buy this product because canon local service center is of no help even in providing the product demo. We logged the complain on canon India site and not bothered to reply. Amazon call raised its hand saying \"proof of non service\" from local service center. So we have a DSLR that is producing blur images and canon is not providing any proper service. stay away', 'Request for replacement of camera main body  There is lot of blackspot/blackness automatically appears in View finder mirror just after 15 days.It is requested to please replace the camera as soon as possible.Awaiting early reply.Regards.', 'I have received my product DSLR Cannon 1500D at 15 the October 2018 . But Adopter has not been given along with the DSLR which is a very common accessories.They must deliver that as soon as possible.Otheewise I gave to complain about it again & again.', \"Auto focus is not at all perfect.Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.Plastic quality is poor.I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300.\", \"If you want to upgrade your camera from point and shoot to a dslr then it is a good camera for you but if you want to start videography then don't buy it auto focus of video is too much bad. If you want  a camera for videography then go foe canon 200D or Nikon D5600\", 'I am really fully content with the product. It reached me within two days with everything  content in it and no doubt in a very good condition. It may be somewhat difficult for the beginners but it will not take a long to learn. If you are choosing between canon and Nikon I will suggest you canon because of its real colour capturing and fine focus of its lenses. You can get more slightly more features in Nikon than canon at the same price but that doesn\\'t mean that will surely better than canon. You can look for contrast between canon and Nikon in the internet. I think it will suggest you the same\"canon\".', 'Canon Has Cheated The entire photography community. if you are a photographer and use flash or studio lights this camera is not for you. do not buy external flash and studio ligits like elinchrom and godox will not work.  .reason why i am saying this.the mount on with the flash is put has one point of contact missing. in 1500d they have removed the main point of contact . 1300d has it. go for 1300d .', 'Dear friends i buy this camera for my YouTube career😞 and if you’re buying this camera for your YouTube career then its not for you. Bcz this camera doesn’t have mic input, and its also not takes a great videos, you’re not able to record great videos without mic input. No auto focus option in video recording, basic camera 📷!! This camera only good for pictures clicks!', 'This camera is a perfect choice if you are a beginner. The price range is decent, the camera is user friendly. I recommend everyone to buy this camera if you have a tight budget.', \"I paid Rs 20240 for this product and have read some of the reviews, and  I can say I bought it expensive. Some people got it for Rs 18000 in the offer period. I tried some of its features and felt terribly disappointed. The autofocus is a joke here. It takes forever to click a photo in just slightest low light. I was very annoyed. I feel like I should have bought a cyber shot instead. Nikon D3500 is way better than it hands down in terms of clarity of photographs, quality, ISO, battery, grip and display. However, you'll have to pay Rs 3000-4000 more, but that's worth it. You don't buy DSLRs every day. Choose a better camera.\", 'Good Product who are really have  passion for photography', \"Got dual lens with body in just 28K with SBI MASTERCARD.

Well it was an awesome deal from amazon purchased it for around ₹21.5k with a free gift Motorola wired headphone worth ₹650.Coming to the camera it’s a great learning camera especially for the beginners who love photography and also want themselves to enhance here. My personal experience after using it for a week for now with the combination of shutter speed,aperture and ISO with a desired white balance you can be click practically any of the desired picture that you want to click.The camera comes with a 18-55 lens that is self acclaimed for beginners. Do master your parameters with this lens then you can obviously go for desired range of lens available in the market.The only shortcoming that I personally found was the focus which need to be adjusted manually/you need to have patience while clicking raw pictures. But this is again not a shortcoming for sure this is the area you need to improve yourself over the camera.', \"The camera is in good condition...I have received the charger and the battery but it doesn't charge the battery....charger received is faulty..don't know how to go about it....as really frustrated ..there is no return policy also....\", \"It's a best entry level DSLR camera if you have used only point and shoot or mobile. It has built in guide which makes it easier to use and learn. The auto focus and pictures quality is also very good but some time in low lit situations it generates noiy in pictures for that use extra flash other wise best. Videos are also very good for blogging video use manual focus which is very eyes to use with best results. It's better than Nikon d3500 as videos, auto focus and features are better in this camera. If your budget is limited and you are new in DSLR then it's a must buy.\", 'Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue.', 'This may be a good camera for the very experienced professional of photography. It is challenging for a newcomer in photography.1-Flash Makes too much noise2-You cannot record a  good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.4-Wifi does not control the video recording function5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.if canon disprove me, I will remove this product review or update it', \"First of all thanks Amazon for giving such a wonderful offer , my dream comes true and finally I have dslr....Picture quite is awesome in both day light as well as low light.

Otherwise....*Excellent DSLR for beginners.*Easy to use.*Good quality.*Decent battery backup.*Worth for moneyFact: If your expectations are high with the stabilization or photo output etc then please go for Canon 5D/7D. This is for beginners (21K) and so if you buy this then keep your expectations as much you pay. :p :)', \"I had only 3 hours to make the decision. Next day I had my flight to Korea and we thought of buying a DSLR at night (didn't make a decision earlier, as we had One+ and iPhone which are kind of best in class for the camera). So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures. I am attaching a few pics which I captured with just 2 hours of the experiment.\", 'The battery is faulty .... It drains even when not in use', \"WARRANTY CAN BE REGISTERED!! IT HAS 2 YRS WARRANTY!!!Just finished registering the camera and lens.Great camera. You will love it. Very steady. Great buy to start your hobby/profession. Don't compare to other cameras. At 26k good its a great dslr with 2yrs warranty. Should take care of parties, weddings and video shoots. Excellent battery life. The camera case is good.It has no external mic in.\", \"Let me explain.Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.But those are most of its negatives.The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.Why is it the best DSLR?Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion.\", 'I wanted to return this order on the same day and purchase Canon 200D as I did not like it.. but never had an option to do that.

If you want good SDHC Memory card you can go for Sandisk 32 gb or Higher . It will give you a speed of 90mbps.4.You will get a diopter adjustment dial just at the right side of the optical view finder.5.Screen brightness at level 4 is probably enough for everyone , where you can extend the lcd brightness hoto 8th level . You van guess how much bright it's actually . Easy for outdoors also.👉 It's a bit noisy when you shoot in low light , so try to keep atleast minimum light source  near your object . Try to keep ISO minimum , change your shutter speed , keep it at 1/10 or lower if the condition outside is too much dark .The price for which I got these is around 24000 .

Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it’s just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package.It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price.

Canon1500D has a  superior sensor over the older EOS 1300D  Thus, overall image quality is much better. Color saturation is decent and a fair amount of sharpness , As far as noise is concerned, the camera handles shots well up to ISO 1600 with a little amount of grains Even at ISO 800, the noise levels are acceptable. Increasing  ISO to 1600 increases the noise but the images were still good enough to be shared on social medias.

So this will just give auto focus to a particular object only and when your object go front and back.. this get automatically blurred in case of video. This is my honest review so don't buy this camera for YouTube video like cooking, art and craft etc. You don't get return and refund so go to shop and try the camera range before buying for your particular purpose. For photography you can buy this. But for video this is the worst camera I ever used. I don't expect such a bad autofocus.. after doing manual focus settings then also this camera will stuck to that particular silent no motion,,, object only.

I bought it for 30k with both 18-55mm lens and 55-250mm lens.  It was a sweet deal at that point of time.The ISO performance is not great so wouldn't recommend for low light photography. Till ISO 800 the images turn out to be good. The noise starts to creep in above 800.It has a continuous shooting speed of 3fps so not great for birds or fast moving objects.The auto focus is quite slow and there are only 9 AF points. The processor is DIGIC 4+ and that is quite weak compared to DIGIC 7 and 8 which comes in 800D and 200D.  The 800D has 45 AF points while the 200D. Both 200D and 800D also offer dual pixel AF which is much faster.Built-in WiFi feature is great to control the camera using mobile phone and transfer files wirelessly. Note that only JPG files can transferred using the canon android app not RAW images.If you can stretch your budget than do get 800D or 200D, otherwise at 30k this is a great deal with 2 lenses.\", 'As a beginner I really liked this camera, I used Nikon 3300 before, but this one is simple awesome.

Shoots only at 1080p30 where the above phones do 4K60p4. Video quality is just acceptable and very low stabilization if any with the included lens.5. Not that great in low light.6. Loud mirror noises ( Better to go with a mirrorless ).For a casual photographer, it is Okay. But coming to videos, cheaper point and shoots like Nikon A900, Sony RX100 etc.. record 4K30p and 1080p60p respectively.I\\'ve tested RX100 and 1500D side by side and most of the time and almost in low light, Small Sony RX100 outperformed Canon 1500D.Only for photographers, and also if you are beginner and willing to buy prime lens just after buying this camera.', \"Not at all recommended to anyone! Personal opinion based on 2 months of usage.DO NOT BUY ANY CANON 1200/1300/1500/3000 whatever crap.There a few good things to appreciate on paper but when it cones to practically, it makes you regret your decision. I'm not opposing canon in any way. I have been shooting with Canons for like 6 years professionally now, just recently switched to EOS R from EOS80D but hell no, this whole line-up from canon is bull***t. Not even recommended to beginners. Its better to learn on some friend's DSLR than to buy this piece of disgusting gadget.1. For learning purpose- borrow from a friend, or watch youtube, tonnes of content. Don't waste your money here. (I'll justify my hate just in a few mins.)2. For basic family use- Better buy a point and shoot at a way less price.I ordered it for my neighbours' son to teach him photography but we ended up selling it away in not more than 2 months!! Good decision.The only useful feature? Interchangeable Canon EF/s lenses and 1080p at 24 fps.Crap list?1. misses focus 95/100 times even on slower aperture like f8-f11. very less detailed shots. You CANNOT focus and recompose (the only option as just 9 point focus) even on F8 or F11, the image is just soft, blurry all over and tinted (with kit 18-55 or 55-250) sharpness comes a bit improved upon spending 8k more for a basic prime lens 50mm 1.8 EF.2. Sensor is pathetic! grainy (noise) even on ISO 100! (the lower the ISo, the more sharp picture comes without grains &ISO 100 is minimum here!) I have no idea why. Seriously Canon?3. Auto-Focus is not good. I don't use auto focis but since its targeted towards beginners, autofocus needs to be spot on.overall, not what you expect of a DSLRso what to do?my opinions1. either save a bit more and start off with a canon 200D ATLEAST! or crank up that budget to get an M50 (bang for the buck!!)2. learn on a rented/borrowed camera.3. For family guys, get a point and shoot. Sony makes good point and shoots. Cz either way you ain't gonna be using manual controls.in short- Retarded Product from a very trusted brand. Don't waste your hard earned money or beginner capital.\", 'Packaging could be improved. Outer Amazon box was tampered. Though other aspects were okay, these small things make the difference. Awesome camera. Loved it', 'Good camera', 'An excellent entry level dslr to begin with if you are interested in photography..', 'I am using 700D for professional portfolio shoots.

I got the 1500D after comparing with 3000D and Nikon 350D. This is a great choice for beginner to intermediate photography lovers. Modes are easy to operate. Has dedicated features for food, video, travel and portrait modes. Comes in a beautiful premium camera bag, a 16gb memory card plus a 15-55mm lens. Flash is inbuilt and pops up when u click the flash button. Focus is clear and it has wifi facility. You can pick up the photos from the phone directly from the camera through connecting in the same WiFi network and that's an awesome feature. Highly recommend this. I got it for 20990-2000 card discount and that's a steal at this price. As a travel blogger this Will come in very handy for my photographs though I still need time to master it.

One can polish their skills of photography before looking at higher models.  There is no need go for an expensive DSLR and not having the skills to use it. I am using this camera for some time now and learning the best possible way to take pics in any light.Highly recommended for the initial passion of photography which will bite you. Once you use this camera and want to pursue more then you can look at more expensive cameras. By that time you will know which camera is suitable for you and which photography is your forte. Accordingly you will buy the correct lenses, be it prime lenses, zoom lenses or you want to use only the kit lenses only.BTW the lenses are more important for your photography.', \"Canon and Nikon have been the leaders in the camera space they have a lot of models to offer and it is always confusing to pick the right one.Today I am going to compare the best selling canon 1500 d to the nikon model mentioned below.Check the linkhttps://amzn.to/2TBTvUJA different kithttps://amzn.to/2UQD8DPWhen you compare the 3500 available at the same price the canon simply feels dated, the Nikon has better battery, the difference is not marginal, the battery on the Nikon feels much superior, the maximum iso is also higher and with a large pixel area, I feel the comparison simply feels one sided.With bluetooth and phone control the Nikon is a much better dealBoth the cameras lack an articulating screen which is sad considering how useful it is for Vloggers.Design and buildThe level of quality is impressive from the Japanese brand. Everything feels well built and the buttons have a tactile feel to them. With a decent display, well laid out buttons and compact body this one feels very practical to use.This does not feel super premium, but it isn't supposed to feel like high end cameras to keep costs in check .Performance and image qualityThis is what got me a little disappointed, don't get me wrong this is an absolutely fantastic camera in isolation, it offers great image quality, low light performance and decent performance, but when you put it against the competition it feels a bit dated.ConclusionA good camera, but not my recommendation at this price point. If you want a camera only from the house of canon check this one out.My recommended canon 1500d kit available at a very good deal, discounted price.https://amzn.to/2UQDhHnThank you for reading my review.Hope it helpsGood day!\", 'Awesome product', 'This is best in the segment. I bought it during Amazon Great Indian Sale at RS 20000 after bank discounts (Amazon price during sale was 21500). At this price range, no need to think twice before buying. However, the IS lens 18-55 that comes with it is of no use. Should buy 50mm STM lens and 58-250mm STM lens too. Those lenses with this cam will give you amazingly incredible photos.

I have used for 2months and writing this review.. instead of 18MP Can go for this 24MP. Just Loved it..!\", 'Canon has introduced an entry-level DSLR with a 24.1MP sensor alongside connectivity features such as Wi-Fi and NFC.An unapologetically simple beginner-level DSLR.2017-2018 has been the year of the smartphone. Not only design, display and battery, but more of a cold war on the photography front. Smartphone manufacturers all out to show their prowess with the cameras on their devices. Be it the primary or the selfie cameras, the smartphone today is completely bridging the gap between a professional camera and a smartphone. However, what a DSLR can procure, a smartphone simply still cannot. DSLR cameras are still the king when it comes to image quality. Moreover, when you need to take complete control over your frame and the light you capture, no smartphone has yet managed to come close to the performance that DSLRs can offer. While smartphones can replace point and shoot cameras to an extent, they are soon closing into the DSLR category, but that will take a few more years to come.Professional photographers still use the mighty old DSLR for their work. While they do use smartphones to capture a few shots, the photos cannot be worked on due to limitations of file format (JPG) as RAW images are the ones helps in editing. Hence the DSLR, together with the various lenses, are still here to stay.While it is definitely a difficult job for camera manufacturers is to sell their products in a market that is soon being dominated by smartphone cameras, brands such as Canon, Sony, Nikon and a few others have established their name in the market and offer products that are aimed at different audiences, different budgets, and different photography skill sets.This year, Canon announced the EOS 1500D and the EOS 3000D, both entry-level cameras, with almost similar features aimed at budding photographers who want to enter into the photography game for a more serious form of the art, rather than use their smartphones that offer very limited capabilities.The Canon EOS 1500D replaces the dated EOS 1300D that was released back in 2016. This time, it comes with features such as a 24MP APS-C sized CMOS sensor capable of full HD video recording, burst shooting at 3fps, 9-point AF system and Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity. We put the Canon EOS 1500D to the test so that we can give you our recommendation.', 'one of the best product in this price, great for students and armatures who are starting off with photography.the SD card was missing for my package, however Amazon was quick to send me that as soon as the complaint was registered.easy to operate and handle, It also comes with a basic carriage bad which is decent and makes it easy to carry around.', 'Its a steal deal at 17990 during great indian sale october 2018 .
